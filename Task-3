To build a login and signup page using PHP, HTML, CSS, and MySQL as specified in your task, follow these steps. I'll provide a detailed guide with code examples for each part of the process.
Step 1: Setup the Database
First, you'll need to create a MySQL database to store user credentials. Here's a simple example of how to create a database and a user table.
1.	Create Database:
2.	CREATE DATABASE userDB;
3.	Create User Table:
4.	USE userDB;
5.	CREATE TABLE users (
6.	    id INT(11) NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
7.	    username VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
8.	    password VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
9.	    email VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL
10.	);
Step 2: HTML and CSS for Frontend
Next, create the HTML for the login and signup forms, and style them using CSS.
HTML - index.html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Login and Signup</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
</head>
<body>
    <div class="form-container">
        <form action="login.php" method="post">
            <h2>Login</h2>
            <input type="text" name="username" placeholder="Username" required>
            <input type="password" name="password" placeholder="Password" required>
            <button type="submit">Login</button>
        </form>
        <form action="signup.php" method="post">
            <h2>Signup</h2>
            <input type="text" name="username" placeholder="Username" required>
            <input type="password" name="password" placeholder="Password" required>
            <input type="email" name="email" placeholder="Email" required>
            <button type="submit">Signup</button>
        </form>
    </div>
</body>
</html>
CSS - styles.css
body {
    font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
}

.form-container {
    width: 300px;
    margin: auto;
    padding: 20px;
    border: 1px solid #ccc;
    border-radius: 5px;
    box-shadow: 2px 2px 8px #aaa;
}

form {
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: column;
}

input, button {
    margin-bottom: 10px;
    padding: 10px;
    border-radius: 5px;
}

button {
    cursor: pointer;
    background-color: blue;
    color: white;
}
Step 3: PHP for Backend
Create PHP scripts to handle login and signup functionality.
Login - login.php
<?php
$servername = "localhost";
$username = "root";
$password = "";
$dbname = "userDB";

$conn = new mysqli($servername, $username, $password, $dbname);

if ($conn->connect_error) {
    die("Connection failed: " . $conn->connect_error);
}

$user = $_POST['username'];
$pass = $_POST['password'];

$sql = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE username='$user' AND password='$pass'";
$result = $conn->query($sql);

if ($result->num_rows > 0) {
    echo "Login successful";
} else {
    echo "Invalid username or password";
}
$conn->close();
?>
Signup - signup.php
<?php
$servername = "localhost";
$username = "root";
$password = "";
$dbname = "userDB";

$conn = new mysqli($servername, $username, $password, $dbname);

if ($conn->connect_error) {
    die("Connection failed: " . $conn->connect_error);
}

$user = $_POST['username'];
$pass = $_POST['password'];
$email = $_POST['email'];

$sql = "INSERT INTO users (username, password, email) VALUES ('$user', '$pass', '$email')";

if ($conn->query($sql) === TRUE) {
    echo "New record created successfully";
} else {
    echo "Error: " . $sql . "<br>" . $conn->error;
}

$conn->close();
?>
Notes:
•	Ensure your server supports PHP and MySQL.
•	Replace "root" and "" in the PHP scripts with your actual database username and password.
•	Use proper security measures in production, such as using prepared statements with MySQLi to prevent SQL injection and hashing passwords before storing them in the database.
This setup gives you a basic login and signup system. You can extend and improve upon it as needed!
Based on the task description you provided for "Task3: Login Signup Page" built with PHP, HTML, CSS, and MySQL, here's a textual outline of what the output would look like when the forms are processed correctly:
Login Form Output:
1.	Successful Login:
o	If the username and password entered in the login form are correct and match an entry in the database, the output will be: 
o	Login successful
2.	Failed Login:
o	If the username and password do not match any entry in the database, the output will be: 
o	Invalid username or password
Signup Form Output:
1.	Successful Signup:
o	If the new user's information (username, password, email) is successfully inserted into the database, the output will be: 
o	New record created successfully
2.	Failed Signup:
o	If there is an error during the insertion process (such as a duplicate username, depending on database constraints), the output will include the error message from the MySQL database. This might look like: 
o	Error: [error details from the MySQL server]
These outputs are generated by the PHP scripts login.php and signup.php after processing the form data. Here's a recap of how each script contributes to these outputs:
•	login.php: Checks the provided username and password against the database. If a match is found, it confirms successful login; otherwise, it reports an invalid login attempt.
•	signup.php: Attempts to insert the new user's data into the database. If successful, it confirms that a new record was created. If not, it provides an error message detailing the issue.
Note:
•	For actual production use, it's crucial to handle errors and user feedback appropriately to ensure a good user experience and security. For example, using session management for logged-in users and providing more user-friendly error messages.
•	Always use hashed passwords in your database and PHP's built-in functions like password_hash() for hashing and password_verify() for checking passwords.
This explanation assumes the backend processing is set up as described and that the database is configured correctly. If you have the scripts running on a server and need specific help with any errors or outputs, you can provide the error messages or further details for more tailored assistance.
